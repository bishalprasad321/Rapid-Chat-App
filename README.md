## Lessons Learned

- I've faced the challenges regarding the fetching and updating the firestore firebase database through the application. So, learned how to integrate that and work on realtime database environment.
- Though the flutter documentation is a great place to get a help, It'll not always help you in building your custom app. But I've learned how to use the documentation efficiently and cutomize the code as per my needs.
